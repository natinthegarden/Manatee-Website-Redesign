# Manatee-Website-Redesign
Manatee Website Redesign for front end web development practice

## Description of Project
	For this learnign project to experiment with the basics of website building, I remade the Save the Manatee online shop.
This is *by no means* a design project, but a fun first website building experiment to practice HTML, CSS, and small amount of JavaScript. 
Mine is not a functional online shop, but was great practice to explore web development building blocks.

## CSS Elements Included
My project’s CSS file includes (but is not limited to): 
* navigation menu that expands and collapses, switching between vertical and horizontal based on screen size 
* flexbox system that organizes the page’s content (the footer items and shop gallery change their layout according to screen size) 
* CSS animation moving text across the page upon loading the ‘adoption page’ 
* navigation menu CSS animation of an eased transitional color change when one hovers over links
* Button styling change on click and change of form input field on-focus/when typing text on the 'adoption page'

I also learned how to add a favicon to a website tab, create a hero-image (for the adoption page), 
and got practice using the inspect tool when examining the original website to pull color schemes and the like. 

## Media Queries and JavaScript Included
There are two media queries in my CSS for tablet and large screens. 
The changes are best demonstrated in the footer (the four items of content rearrange based on screen size), 
but this grid rule is also used on the content of the shop gallery.

My JavaScript file has code that shows and hides the navigation menu through a click of the hamburger button (on small screens). Also, a smaller incomplete function is that the form on the adoption page alerts a user if the field is empty.

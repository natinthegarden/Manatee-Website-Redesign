# Manatee-Website-Redesign
Manatee Website Redesign for front end web development practice

## Description of Project
	For my project I redesigned the online gift shop of the Save the Manatees website!
The Save the Manatee charity's current online shop (https://www.shopsavethemanatee.org/) is dated but usable. 
I’ve bought gifts through this site and wished they had a newer design to make purchasing feel more secure. 
This was a fun first project to practice HTML, CSS, and small amount of JavaScript. 
Mine is not a functional online shop, but was great practice to explore web development building blocks.

## CSS Elements Included
My project’s CSS file includes (but is not limited to): 
* navigation menu that expands and collapses, switching between vertical and horizontal based on screen size 
* flexbox system that organizes the page’s content (the footer items and shop gallery change their layout according to screen size) 
* CSS animation moving text across the page upon loading the ‘adoption page’ 
* navigation menu animation of a color change with an ease transition when one hovers over links
* ease-in-out transition when either button is selected on the forms of the 'adoption page'

I also learned how to add a favicon to a website tab, create a hero-image (for the adoption page), 
and got practice using the inspect tool when examining the original website to pull color schemes and the like. 

## Media Queries and JavaScript Included
There are two media queries in my CSS for tablet and large screens. 
The changes are best demonstrated in the footer (the four items of content rearrange based on screen size), 
but this grid rule is also used on the content of the shop gallery.

My JavaScript file has code that shows and hides the navigation menu through a click of the hamburger button (on small screens). Also, a smaller function is that the form on the adoption page alerts a user if the field is empty.
